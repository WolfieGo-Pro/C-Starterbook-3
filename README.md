# C++ Starterbook-3

Continuation form C++ Starterbook-2 including OOP concepts, Class, Object instantiation, Pointers, 
Dynamic Memory Allocation and a deeper understanding as to what problem I am trying to solve through code.

In this branch, I am practicing with bit manipulation, data comparison and
bit shifting.
